//entrypoint is a runtime and overwrite command
docker run busybox
//it immediately exits the command
docker inspect busybox

//cmd is sh and entrypoint is null meaninng we need to do it to start the container
docker run -it busybox
ps
ls /bin
hostname
date
exit

//look at dockerfile 6
//go to the directory
docker build -t hostname .
docker run hostname
docker run hostname date

//now go ahead and replace cmd with entrypoint
docker build -t entryhostname .
docker run entryhostname
docker run entryhostnamehostname date // shows an error , diff between cmd and entrypoint
docker run --entrypoint date entryhostname

////////////

// entrypoint and cmd together
see dockerfile 6 -> .
docker run --name myshell -it mysql sh
//these are shell tricks cause if you open the container in another termianl it will show the shell working and entrypoint doesnt raise any unwanted errors
