we can easily deploy containers everywhere and on anyones hardware
how do we contorl our container across many servers or instances
automate container lifecycle--
how can we easily scalr out.in.up.downhow can we ensure our containers are recreated if they fail
how can we replace containers without downtime
how can er control track where containers get started
how can we create cross node virtual networks
how can we store private info..

solution:swarm mode
swarm mode is a clustering solution built inside docker

docker info
it will show swarm status
good chance it will show deactivate

so do 
docker swarm init

docker node ls
it will be marked as leader

docker service command replace the docker run in swarm

docker service create alpine ping 8.8.8.8
it will give you an id, which is a service id
docker service ls

docker service ps [id]
will show the containers for the services
it will show a node column

docker service update [id] --replicas 3
docker service ls
docker service ps

docker container ls
docker container rm -f <name>.1.<id>
docker service ls
docker service ps <id>
it will show the one that was shutdown

docker service rm <id>
docker service ls
docker container ls


for this next section you will need node clusters so multiple machines with docker installed:
this can be done by:
play-with-docker.com: only 4 hrs
docker-machine + virtualbox: need a lot of ram memory to run 3 linux servers
digital ocean + docker install: paid
or having different machines with docker installed

we will go with the digital ocean one:
ssh root@<ip address>
docker swarm init
will show error

docker swarm init  --advertise-addr <ip address>
you will get a join command displayed on the screen
can take that and paste on to your other machines

docker node ls 
you can oly use this command as a leader, workers are not allowed 

but you can make others manager by
docker node update --role manager node2 
docker node ls
node2 will now be called reachable


you can also start a machine by manager token
docker swarm join-token manager
will give you a join command paste it in the other machine
docker node ls

docker service create --replaces 3 alpine ping 8.8.8.8
docker service ls
docker node ps
docker node ps node 2
docker service ps <service name>
