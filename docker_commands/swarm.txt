we can easily deploy containers everywhere and on anyones hardware
how do we contorl our container across many servers or instances
automate container lifecycle--
how can we easily scalr out.in.up.downhow can we ensure our containers are recreated if they fail
how can we replace containers without downtime
how can er control track where containers get started
how can we create cross node virtual networks
how can we store private info..

solution:swarm mode
swarm mode is a clustering solution built inside docker

docker info
it will show swarm status
good chance it will show deactivate

so do 
docker swarm init

docker node ls
it will be marked as leader

docker service command replace the docker run in swarm

docker service create alpine ping 8.8.8.8
it will give you an id, which is a service id
docker service ls

docker service ps [id]
will show the containers for the services
it will show a node column

docker service update [id] --replicas 3
docker service ls
docker service ps

docker container ls
docker container rm -f <name>.1.<id>
docker service ls
docker service ps <id>
it will show the one that was shutdown

docker service rm <id>
docker service ls
docker container ls
