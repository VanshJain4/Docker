configure relationship between containers
save out docker container run settings in easy to read file
create one liner developer environment startups

2 parts of compose
1. yml -> list all containers, solution, networks, volumes
2. cli tool docker-compose -> test automation and stuff

docker-compose2.yml and the conf file are linked in this
just simply 
docker compose up 
and it should do everything that needs to be done
you will directly see all the logs on you terminal
docker compose ps
docker compose top
docker compose down

for docker-compose5 also add -v at the end to remove all the volumes as well

compose can build images at runtime
using the up command
great for complex builds that have alot of vars or build args
see docker-compose 6
if nginx is not available it will use the build portion of the script and make the build first and then it will run the container
if you do a docker compose down, it wont delete the image, 
you have to do docker compise down --rmi local

look at docker compose 7 and the dockerfile for this task
